All the questions featured in this repository can be found on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com).

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the solutions, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the following data structures and algorithms:

- Arrays
- Maps
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary search
- Recursion

These fundamentals will be invaluable as you work through the solutions.

## Solutions

## Tips for Problem Solving

When tackling Leetcode problems, consider these strategies to guide your approach:

**For Sorted Input:**
- Use Binary Search or Two Pointers.

**For Permutations or Subsets:**
- Employ Backtracking.

**When Dealing with Trees:**
- Opt for Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**Working with Graphs:**
- Rely on DFS and BFS.

**For Linked Lists:**
- Apply the Two Pointers technique.

**When Recursion is Not an Option:**
- Turn to a Stack.

**In-Place Solutions:**
- Use value swapping or recycle the same pointer.

**Maximum/Minimum Subarray or Subset:**
- Explore Dynamic Programming.

**Top/Least K Items:**
- Utilize a Heap.

**Common Strings:**
- Harness the power of Maps or Tries.

**General Cases:**
- Employ Maps or Sets for O(1) time complexity and O(n) space.
- Or, sort the input for O(nlogn) time complexity and O(1) space.

These strategies will help you navigate a wide range of Leetcode problems effectively.
